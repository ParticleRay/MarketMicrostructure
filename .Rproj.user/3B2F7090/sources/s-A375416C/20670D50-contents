title: Impact of Market Structure
---

Given that a market is where traders meet in order to buy and sell securities, the main optimisation problem faced is related to best searching for an interested counterparty to trade with. 

The process by which a market comes to know the true value or price of a security is known as **price discovery**. An individual trader very rarely knows how a market might exactly respond to information or news, and so the market price is collectively ‘discovered’. 

Below highlighted are features of market quality, which are mechanisms of helping measure and reduce the mentioned problem in market structures. Without upholding these elements of market quality, the price discovery process is one that can be incredibly volatile resulting in significant price fluctuations and mispricing of securities over time. 


## Market Liquidity

Put simply, liquidity is a fairly broad term that references the friction or difficulty that traders face when they use a market. Highly liquid markets have lower costs and orders are filled and executed instantaneously. Liquidity can be broken into 4 key factors:

## Transparency

The concept of transparency is one related to information. When more information about a particular security or market is known, the market is said to be more transparent. Such information might include trading volumes, historical prices as well as counterparty information. 

Equity markets are generally seen to be transparent whilst currency markets are seen to be opaque given that FX exists as an OTC market where trades need not be reported and bid-ask spreads are not readily available.

> It is also important to note that transparency does not imply full information about the market exists. 

## Latency

Latency is a concept closely related to that of immediacy when discussing market liquidity in that they both reference speed. However, latency specifically references the delay between when a trader submits an order to the market and when the market receives and acts on the order. 

Latency is linked to market technology and is measured in milli or micro seconds from the time a trader’s computer sends an order, to when the market computer sends a responding message confirming the order is received.

## Fairness/Manipulation

Whilst not a objectively defined term, fairness refers to the idea that markets can be manipulated to the point where trader outcomes become distorted. This can occur through a variety of market techniques such as spoofing, pump and dump and wash sales.

Any actions with fraudulent or deliberate malicious intent harm the fairness of a market and can severely affect prices and spread.
