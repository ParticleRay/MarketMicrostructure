In quote driven markets (also known as dealer markets), final traders are not able to trade among other market participants, rather, they require a dealer to participate in every trade to facilitate it.

Key points about Quote Driven Markets:

* Dealers post bid and ask quotes and trade on their own accounts
  * Unlike auctioneers in Order Driven Markets
* Decentralised market as all trading is not consolidated in one place- it is Over-the-Counter (OTC), which is through a network of dealers
* Execution of best quotes are not automatic as prices for buying and selling can be negotiated by brokers
* Stocks are not the only securities being traded- treasuries, corporate bonds and currencies are also traded.

A standard table format recording the bid and ask quotes for Dealer Markets could look like this.

It would provide the Dealer code, bid and ask prices, quote size and time of last quote update.

To further simplify how a Dealer Market functions, the following diagram demonstrates how buyers and sellers interact with various dealers and finally how dealers interact with the Interdealer Market.

The Interdealer Market is a Business-to-Business (B2B), where almost 2/3 of total trading volume in FX occurs, which is a large fraction of the Dealer Markets.
