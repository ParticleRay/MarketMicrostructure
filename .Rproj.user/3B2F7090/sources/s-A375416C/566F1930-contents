# Investors

With continuous advancements in online trading platforms and improved access to information, retail investors, who are defined as non-professional individuals that choose to invest directly in the equities market rather than depositing money in financial institutions bank or mutual funds, account for almost as much volume on the US stock market as mutual and hedge funds combined.

> In Australia, the number of retail investors increased by 100% since May 2020 with an estimated 1.43 million individuals placing one or more trades during this period.

Furthermore, a low interest rate environment has been a key catalyst for investors entering the market in recent years. With an aim to stimulate the and support the economy, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has reduced the cash rate to a historic low of 0.1% in November 2020.

# Brokers

Brokers are also a fundamental part of the equities market - acting as an agent on behalf of their customers by representing their orders to the market. In return, brokers receive a fee for their services - traditionally through a commission on the trade however, exchange maker/taker pricing and payment for retail order flow have been more prominent throughout the past decade.

There are 2 main types of brokers:

1.  Prime Brokers: Provides transaction-related services for larger customers e.g. corporations, mutual funds
2.  Retail Brokers: Individual investors go to discount brokers who only provide trading services or full-service brokers that provide more comprehensive services including advisory and portfolio management.Â
