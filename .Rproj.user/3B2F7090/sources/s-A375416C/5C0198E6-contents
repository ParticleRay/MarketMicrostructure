## Brokered Markets

Brokered markets follow the execution system, where the broker actively arranges trades. Market participants contact the broker to find counterparties to trade. However, brokered markets are unique as it usually arises when the item being traded is unique and dealers are unwilling to hold inventories.

This results in aiding market efficiency by fostering faster trade and boosting transaction volumes as brokers help complete transactions. A disadvantage of brokered markets is that there will usually be a higher commission paid by market participants to compensate the brokers for their work.

## Hybrid Markets

A mix characteristics of quote-driven, order-driven and brokered markets. Most famous hybrid market being the NYSE, which features a specialist (a designated dealer who quotes the prices at which trades will be bought and sold at), that ensures a minimum liquidity but competes with a LOB.
Hybrid markets exist for securities which may be traded simultaneously in different trading mechanisms in the same or different market.

For example a typical equities market such as the ASX has various trading phases which contain two Call Markets at the opening/closing auctions, with a Continuous Market in between.
